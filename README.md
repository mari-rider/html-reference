# html-reference

(Codecademy Project) In this project, you’ll be building your own reference cheat sheet to help you build more websites in the future! Although there are great places to learn HTML &amp; CSS like Codecademy, the best reference for yourself is often your own notes and projects.


Your project should document at least one HTML or CSS topic. In our example project, we documented the tags and attributes used in HTML tables layouts, but you can choose any HTML or CSS topic that you’ve learned so far—the sky is the limit!

Your site uses HTML tables to display the documentation. Be sure to label the columns in your HTML.

In our example site, we used tables with columns for:

The tag or attribute name
The actual formatted tag (eg. <table>)
A description of what to use the tag for.
You can use these same columns or choose your own.
  
Your site should utilize a custom color scheme. You can use any of the named CSS colors.
  
Your site should use custom styles for any code such as HTML tags (like < h1 >) or CSS properties or values (like font-family). Represent code using a monospace font family and a different background color.
